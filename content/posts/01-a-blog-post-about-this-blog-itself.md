## Coming up with the design

I've been wanting to set up a blog for several years now, but I didn't want to use a cookie-cutter template. I wanted to
make a design from scratch that actually looked good to *me*. The problem is, I have no artistic talent for this kind of
thing. Show me a design and I can probably tell you what looks good and what does not (at least in my opinion), but
making one from scratch is, to say the least, *hard*.

So for the last two years, everytime I came across a website and thought "This looks super nice!", I'd note it down it
in a list. That list has become pretty long at this point, so I'll only mention the ones that I feel were the most
influential:
[Adam Blank](https://countablethoughts.com/),
[Notes on Data Structures and Programming Techniques](https://cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html),
[Nota](https://nota-lang.org/),
[Daemonic Dispatches](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/),
[Urban Terror](https://www.urbanterror.info/home/),
[Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/),
[Satvik Saha](https://sahasatvik.github.io/),
[Tony Zorman](https://tony-zorman.com/).

## Reinventing the static site generator wheel for kicks

Since I was already doing the design from scratch, I figured I might as well do the static site generator from scratch
too. I didn't want to fight my setup in case whichever one I picked would not do things *exactly* how I wanted. And how
hard could a static site generator really be? Yeah, I keep falling for that one.

That said, I'm mostly done with the scripts I'm using to generate this site. It has most run-of-the-mill features you'd
expect from a static site generator, even some extras like a font subsetting script.
