It's a bright Friday morning. You've just woken up, refreshed and ready to tackle the day. You turn on your computer,
open a terminal, and start vigorously typing in the same trusty command you've always used to ssh into your VPS. With
each keystroke you can feel a disturbance in the force, and within milliseconds after pressing enter, you see:

```bash
$ ssh user@myvps
user@myvps: Permission Denied (publickey)
```
